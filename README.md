Spin glass model which generates a time series from it's magnetization. We are interested in couplings that come from heavy-tailed distributions. We study Ising spins and Heisenberg spins in spinglass.ipynb and tertiary spins in spinglass2.ipynb. The codes produce time series and resulting distributions of the spin glass model. Furthermore, some chaos analysis is done for the Ising spin.
